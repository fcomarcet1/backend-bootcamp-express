# HTML5 Test Page

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/html5-test-page.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/html5-test-page)

This is a test page filled with common HTML elements to be used to provide visual feedback whilst building CSS systems and frameworks.

I have not been able to find a dead-simple, standalone test page out there, so I made one. The HTML elements are loosely categorized as either text, embedded content, or form elements.
